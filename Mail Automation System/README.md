# Mail Automation System
This is a simple project which can automatically send some preselected message to an email address. 
### Background:
This was built as a prototype of a project proposal for H&M company. Employee's of H&M company send emails to the vendors for products. As the vendors are not smart enough, they do not check their emails regularly. As a result, employees need to send some follow-up messages to draw the vendor's attention. 

This project solves the problem of repeatedly sending follow-up messages by automating this process where users can write some follow-up messages at once and set a time interval after which each follow-up message will be sent. This process will continue until receiving a reply from the vendor/targeted person.
