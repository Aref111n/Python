# Mail Automation System
This is a simple project which can automatically send some preselected messages to an email address. 
### Background:
This was built as a prototype of a project proposal for H&M company. Employees of H&M company send emails to the vendors for products. As the vendors are not smart enough, they do not check their emails regularly. As a result, employees need to send some follow-up messages to draw the vendor's attention. 

This project solves the problem of repeatedly sending follow-up messages by automating this process where users can write some follow-up messages at once and set a time interval after which each follow-up message will be sent. This process will continue until receiving a reply from the vendor/targeted person. 

### Limitations & Scope
This project is currently only available for Outlook mail. That means the sender's email must be an Outlook email. But it can be easily changed to make it flexible for any Gmail service provider.
