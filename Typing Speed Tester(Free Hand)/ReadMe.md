I choosed KPM over WPM because words can vary. Some words are very small and some are very large. 
And also I didn't gave any paragraph to write following that. Because There are some people who can easily 
memorize huge part of a line and write it. But some people like me, We have to look through the paragraph 
again and again. Surely that harms typing speed. So I offer `Free hand typing skill test`. Write whatever 
you wish. For example if you are a programmer, You can write a program to add two integer and result the sum.
